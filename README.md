## Install

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/AtDeadOfNight/cheats/releases)
2. Unpack `release.zip` to `package.nw` directory in At Dead of Night game's files. You should now have `cheats` directory near other files such as `index.html` and `package.json`
3. Add `<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cheats/connector.js"></script>` line before `</html>` to `package.nw/index.html` file in At Dead of Night game's files
> [!CAUTION]
> Read the 3rd step again, carefully. You may have placed the script line before `<html>` (in start of file).
> You MUST place it before `</html>` ‚Äî notice the slash. It is the last tag in index.html file. **Not in start of file**
5. Open At Dead of Night, all cheats must apear now
- If you ever want to **disable all cheats**, simply remove `cheats` directory from `package.nw` directory
- If you want to **disable some cheats**, simply navigate to `cheats/connector.js` file, go to the end of the file and find functions invocations like `initRadar()` and others. Prepend every line with cheat you do not want to appear in the game with `//`. For example, if you leave `// initRadar()` in connector.js, Radar will not appear in the game after next launch.

## Common problems

<details>
  <summary>Cheats do not appear</summary>
  
  I've tested these cheats multiple times, multiple people installed it before you and it is definetely not a problem related to your hardware. Either you did something wrong (most likely), or I published broken release (try downloading previous version of cheats in Release tab) or new version of game appeared that broke the cheats.

  You are likely **did 3rd step wrong** by placing `<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cheats/connector.js"></script>` line in the wrong place. index.html has `<html>` and `</html>` tags. You probably placed this line in start of file, near opening html tag (without slash) doctype tag. You must **place it in end of file**, before closing html tag (with slash).
